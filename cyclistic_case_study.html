        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify key differences between casual and member riders in order to generate actionable insights for strategic decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Cyclistic Historic Data made available by Motivate International, Inc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Trip Volume: Member riders exhibit significantly higher trip frequency compared to casual riders.</li>
            <li>Bike Preference: A clear divergence in bike type preference exists, with casual riders favoring electric bikes (57%) and member riders preferring classic bikes (55%).</li>
            <li>Ride Duration: Analysis of ride duration reveals that casual rides average 21 minutes and 18 seconds, while member rides average 13 minutes and 47 seconds.</li>
            <li>Weekday vs. Weekend Usage (Members): Member rider trip frequency is higher during weekdays compared to weekends.</li>
            <li>Weekday vs. Weekend Usage (Casuals): While casual riders also exhibit a tendency towards increased weekday usage, the difference between weekday and weekend trip frequency is less pronounced than that observed among member riders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Explore strategies to encourage casual electric bike users to become members, potentially through adjustments to electric bike availability for non-members. </li>
            <li>Recommend a comprehensive analysis of the current casual rider pricing structure, including the potential benefits of transitioning to a ride-length-based model.</li>
            <li>Enhance the value proposition for casual riders by introducing a lower-cost membership tier that aligns with their lower trip frequency.</li>
        </ol>
